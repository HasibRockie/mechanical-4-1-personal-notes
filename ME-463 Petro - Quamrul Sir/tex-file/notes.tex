\textbf{Introduction of Petroleum Geology \& Drilling}

\hfill Published by BUET

\subsection*{Basics}

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1\textwidth}@{}}
Latin: \textbf{Petra} → Rock or Stone \\
Latin: \textbf{Oleum} → Oil \\
So, Petroleum basically means "Rock Oil"\\
\\

Petroleum occurs widely in the earth as gas, liquid, semi-solid or solid, or in more than one state in a single place.
\end{tabular}
\\

\subsection*{Definition}
Chemically, any petroleum is an extremely complex mixture of hydrocarbon (hydrogen and carbon) compounds with minor amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur as impurities. The weight percentage of petroleum is as follows:
\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X X}
  \hline
  \textbf{Elements} & \textbf{Amount} \\
  \hline
  Carbon & 85\%-90\% \\
  Hydrogen & 10\%-15\% \\
  Sulfur & 0.2\%-5\% \\
  $N_{2}$ & 0.1\%-2\% \\
  $O_{2}$ & 0.6\%-2\% \\

\section{Lecture 2: Petroleum Classification}
\hfill Date: 17/06/2023

\paragraph*{} A petroleum deposit must be commercially valuable. it depends on some factors: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Amount recoverable 
  \item Expected production rate 
  \item Cost of drilling and producing well
\end{enumerate}

$\checkmark$ if there is fire in well, then another well should be dug nearly to reach there. 

\subsection*{Petroleum Reservoir characteristics}
A good reservoir must have: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Right shape or configuration to hold the oil and some kind of seal or trap to keep it from escaping
  \item it must be large enough usually 10 ft thick or more. 
  \item About 10\% porosity or pore space in needed.
  \item It must be permeable, that is, pores must be connected so that, oil, gas and water can flow through it from one pore to another. 
\end{itemize}

$\checkmark$ Sandstone $\rightarrow$ Porous

\subsection*{Petroleum Classification}
The petroleum and petroleum like substance may be classified as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Petroleum} : An almost infinitely complex mixure of saturated hydrocarbon with relatively small amounts of $S,N_2, O_2$ and many other lesser constituents in combination. Petroleum occurs in solid, liquid and gaseous forms as follows : 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Asphalt or tar, paraffin waxes, brittle bitumen etc.
    \item Crude oils (liquids)
    \item Natural Gas 
  \end{enumerate} 
  \item \textbf{Tar Sands}: Semi-solid petroleum bearing sands 
  \item \textbf{Oild Shales}: These are fine grained sediments sometimes known as kerogen shales. 
  \item Torbanites, boghead and cannel coal etc all are rich in bitumen 
\end{enumerate}

$\checkmark$ Fishing $\rightarrow$ If drill bit is broken inside well \\
$\checkmark$ Catwalk $\rightarrow$ pipe movement through crane 

\subsection*{Age of the earth (Structure of the earth)}
it is very difficult to ascertain the actual and exact of the earth. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Darwin fixed the age of the earth at 57 billion years on the basis of the concept of separation of the moon from the body of the earth.
  \item Through the study of the history of cooling of the earth, calvin estimated that our planet should be as old as 20 to 40 million years 
  \item Study of radioactive naterials in meteorites indicate that the members of the solar system must be as old as about 4500 million years 
  \item Modern theory is that the earth is thought to have formed about 4.6 billion years ago out of a cosmic dust. As the planet was pulled together due to its own gravity, the heat of compression and of it's radioactive elements caused it to become molten. The heaviest components form the core. Lighter minerals form the thick mantle. The lighter elements form the thin rocking crust. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Lecture 3: Internal Structure of the earth crust}
\hfill Date: 08/07/2023 

Internal structure of the earth consists of the followings:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Earth crust 
  \item Mantle 
  \item Core 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Earth Crust (Lithosphere)}
Outer envelope of shell of the earth is known as earth crust. This crust consists of solid rocks. The thickness of earth crust ranges from 5 to 70 km.

Two part of earth's crust:\\
i) Outer crust \\
ii) Lower crust 

\vspace*{0.5cm}
The earth's outer crust mainly consists of sedimentary rocks. \\
Outer crust:\\
i) Continental crust (30 km thick, average specific gravity 2.8, high over 0.2 to 0.3 km above sea)\\
ii) Oceanic crust (5km thick, average specific gravity 2.9, 4 to 5 km sea level)

    \caption{Outer crust \& inner crust} 
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
The lower part of earth crust has two envelopes. \\
Lower crust: \\
i) Granite Layer \\
ii) Basalt Layer \\

\vspace*{0.5cm}
The average thickness of each of this layer ranges from 15 to 20 km. 


\subsection*{Tectonic Plates and Plate Boundaries}
Lithosphere consists of spherical caps or plates. These plates are in relative motion to each other on the non-rigid asthenosphere. \\
There may be a - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Collision
  \item Pulling away 
  \item Slide Past one another 
\end{itemize}

The theory that explains this processes is called plate tectonic theory.

\vspace*{1cm}

Plates may be - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continental (Eurasian Plate) \\ - Thick and relatively light.
  \item Oceanic (Pacific Plate) \\ - Thin and made up of wavy igneous rocks.
\end{itemize}

Mountain ranges, ocean basins, major features of earth etc are found due to the movement of plate boundaries.

\end{figure}


\subsection*{Classification of Plate Boundaries} 
Three types of plate boundaries exist:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Divergent Boundaries 
  \item Convergent Boundaries 
  \item Transcurrent Boundaries 
\end{enumerate}
\hrulefill

\section{Lecture 4: Internal Structure of the earth}
\hfill Date: 08/07/2023 

\begin{multicols*}{2}
  \subsection*{ii) Mantle}
  \subsubsection*{characteristics:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Next to earth's crust 
    \item Rich in Al, Si, Mg 
    \item 2900 km thick 
  \end{itemize}

  It has three sections:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Upper mantle: 40 to 200 km below the earth's surface 
    \item Middle mantle: At a depth of 200 to 1000 km 
    \item Lower mantle: 1000 to 2900 km below the surface of the earth 
  \end{enumerate}
  Maximum temperature of these section in 2200°C. 

  \subsection*{iii) Core}
  \subsubsection*{charateristics:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Next to mantle 
    \item About 3400 km radius 
    \item two parts: Outer core \& Inner core 
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection*{Outer Core:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Temperature 2200°C to 5000°C 
    \item Consists of hot molten nickel, cast iron etc. 
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection*{Inner Core:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The temperature is 5000°C 
    \item Consists of solid balls of iron and nickel.
    \item  The atoms of the metal are pressed together so tightly by gravity that melting is impossible.  
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection*{Tectonic Plates and Plate Boundaries}
  \subsubsection*{(a) Divergent Boundaries:}
  It is a tensile regime, as the two plates of the continent diverges or separates, magma rises from mantle after solidification forms mid-ocean ridge. 

  Example: About 200 million years ago, the atlantic ocean was born in this process. 

  % \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{img/divergent_boun.jpg}


  \subsubsection*{(b) Convergent Boundaries:}
  It is a compressional regime and several things can happen. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ocean-ocean convergent boundaries 
    \item Ocean-continent convergent boundaries 
    \item Continental-continental convergent boundaries 
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection*{Ocean-Ocean convergent boundaries:}
  One plate slips beneath the edge of the other. The lower plate is melted as it moves into the hot mantle. The melting minerals rises through the crust forming granite and other igneous rocks.

  Example: South sandwich trench of atlantic ocean formed in this way. 

  \subsubsection*{Ocean-Continent Convergent Boundaries:}
  Thinner and heavier oceanic plate plunges beneath continental crust, forming a deep sea trench. Magma rises from descending pipe.

  Example: Mount saint helens volcanos formed in this way.

  \subsubsection*{Continent-continent Convergent Boundaries:}
  The collision buckles and folds the rocks.

\section{Lecture 5: Transcurrent Boundaries}
\hfill Date: 22/07/2023 
   
\begin{multicols}{2}
  This is a shear of wrench fault regimes and may have shear, torsional (divergent) or compressional (convergent) components depending on relative movement between the plate boundaries
  

  Example - San Andreas fault in carrizo plain of california.

  \subsection*{Rocks}
  Rocks are natural mineral formation making up earth crust consisting of either dissimilar and similar rock forming materials. 

  \subsection*{Rocks Classification}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Magmatic or igneous: Latin Ignis means fire. 
    
    Formed by solidification of molten minerals matter with originated within the earth.
    \item Sedimentary : Latin sedimentation means settling. \\Are made up of particles derived from the breakdown of older rocks. 
    \item Metamorphic: Greek meta means change and morphe means transformation of previously formed igneous or sedimentary rocks.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

  \section{Lecture 6: Properties of Rocks}
\hfill Date: 05/08/2023

\begin{multicols}{2}
  
  
  The various properties of rocks are determine by their origin and by the geological processes that have been occured over the long period of time the rocks have been in existance.
  
  \subsection*{Properties}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Physical Properties 
    \item Mechanical Properties
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \subsection*{Physical Properties of Rocks}
  Characterized by physical condition. From a great variety of physical properties, we discuss those properties that directly or indirectly affect the drilling process.
  
  Physical properties of rocks are: cohesion, porosity, density, specific gravity, texture, structure and granularity. 

  \subsection*{Mechanical Properties of Rocks}
  Strength, toughness, dynamic strength, hardness, elasticity, brittleness, plasticity, abrasiveness etc. \\

  Physical and mechanical properties of rocks are essential for the following reasons:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Selecting the method of drilling 
    \item Selecting the most effective type rocks breaking tools
    \item Designing optimal drilling and easing programs
    \item Securing geological information
  \end{itemize}

  Special attention is given in studying the physical and mechanical properties of cores, recovered from Stratigraphic test holes. This information is necessary for planning new holes in the same medium. The physical and mechanical properties of rocks depends on their:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item texture
    \item Structure 
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection*{Texture}
  The term texture covers the internal structure of a rock that is the sum of total features determine by- 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Grain shape
    \item Grain size 
    \item Relationship between the rock forming minerals and volcanic glass of cement.
  \end{enumerate}

  The texture of rocks determine by conditions in which they were formed. The principal textures are- 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Crystalline granular 
    \item Inequigranular
    \item Glassy
    \item Clastic
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsubsection*{Structure}
  The term structure is sum of total features determine by the spatial arrangement and orientation of the rock components. The principal rock structures are mentioned as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Massive or Compact structure: Such a structure in typical of magnetic rocks 
    \item Bedded of Stratified Structure: This is the characteristics of sedimentary rocks. 
    \item Schistose Structure: which is found in metamorphic rocks. (flat surface of minerals)
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection*{Other Properties of Rocks}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Porosity, P : The porosity of rocks is the total volume of voids (pores, microcracks etc) it contains. 
    $$P = \frac{V_p}{V} \times 100$$
    where, $V_p = $ pore volume, $V = $ total volume of rock, $\rho = $ Density / mass per unit volume, $\gamma = $ weight per unit volume. 
    \item Strength of Rocks: It is the property of the solid to resist destructions under the action of external loads, either static or dynamic (compression, tension, bending, shear etc).
    \item Toughness: The toughness of rocks implies its capacity to resist external stresses comprising a combination of elementary compressive, tensile, shear stresses. The character of combination depending on breaking the rock. 
    
    The difference between the strength and toughness of rock is that, the strength determines the ability of the rock to resist breakage in a different type of deformation (uniaxial compression, tension, shear), whereas toughness is a measure of rocks resistance to breakage under the action of a combination of several types of deforming stresses.
  \end{enumerate}
