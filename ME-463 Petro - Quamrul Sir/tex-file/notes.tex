\textbf{Introduction of Petroleum Geology \& Drilling}

\hfill Published by BUET

\subsection*{Basics}

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1\textwidth}@{}}
Latin: \textbf{Petra} → Rock or Stone \\
Latin: \textbf{Oleum} → Oil \\
So, Petroleum basically means "Rock Oil"\\
\\

Petroleum occurs widely in the earth as gas, liquid, semi-solid or solid, or in more than one state in a single place.
\end{tabular}
\\

\subsection*{Definition}
Chemically, any petroleum is an extremely complex mixture of hydrocarbon (hydrogen and carbon) compounds with minor amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur as impurities. The weight percentage of petroleum is as follows:
\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X X}
  \hline
  \textbf{Elements} & \textbf{Amount} \\
  \hline
  Carbon & 85\%-90\% \\
  Hydrogen & 10\%-15\% \\
  Sulfur & 0.2\%-5\% \\
  $N_{2}$ & 0.1\%-2\% \\
  $O_{2}$ & 0.6\%-2\% \\

\subsection*{Petroleum Geology}
Geology is the sciecne that deals with the history and structure of the earth and its life forms. It is used to credit where oil accumulation might occur. Geology is based on observation and the knowledge derived from mant others sources.

\section{Lecture 2: Petroleum Classification}
\hfill Date: 17/06/2023

\paragraph*{} A petroleum deposit must be commercially valuable. it depends on some factors: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Amount recoverable 
  \item Expected production rate 
  \item Cost of drilling and producing well
\end{enumerate}

$\checkmark$ if there is fire in well, then another well should be dug nearly to reach there. 

\subsection*{Petroleum Reservoir characteristics}
A good reservoir must have: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Right shape or configuration to hold the oil and some kind of seal or trap to keep it from escaping
  \item it must be large enough usually 10 ft thick or more. 
  \item About 10\% porosity or pore space in needed.
  \item It must be permeable, that is, pores must be connected so that, oil, gas and water can flow through it from one pore to another. 
\end{itemize}

$\checkmark$ Sandstone $\rightarrow$ Porous

\subsection*{Petroleum Classification}
The petroleum and petroleum like substance may be classified as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Petroleum} : An almost infinitely complex mixure of saturated hydrocarbon with relatively small amounts of $S,N_2, O_2$ and many other lesser constituents in combination. Petroleum occurs in solid, liquid and gaseous forms as follows : 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Asphalt or tar, paraffin waxes, brittle bitumen etc.
    \item Crude oils (liquids)
    \item Natural Gas 
  \end{enumerate} 
  \item \textbf{Tar Sands}: Semi-solid petroleum bearing sands 
  \item \textbf{Oild Shales}: These are fine grained sediments sometimes known as kerogen shales. 
  \item Torbanites, boghead and cannel coal etc all are rich in bitumen 
\end{enumerate}

$\checkmark$ Fishing $\rightarrow$ If drill bit is broken inside well \\
$\checkmark$ Catwalk $\rightarrow$ pipe movement through crane 

\subsection*{Age of the earth (Structure of the earth)}
it is very difficult to ascertain the actual and exact of the earth. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Darwin fixed the age of the earth at 57 billion years on the basis of the concept of separation of the moon from the body of the earth.
  \item Through the study of the history of cooling of the earth, calvin estimated that our planet should be as old as 20 to 40 million years 
  \item Study of radioactive naterials in meteorites indicate that the members of the solar system must be as old as about 4500 million years 
  \item Modern theory is that the earth is thought to have formed about 4.6 billion years ago out of a cosmic dust. As the planet was pulled together due to its own gravity, the heat of compression and of it's radioactive elements caused it to become molten. The heaviest components form the core. Lighter minerals form the thick mantle. The lighter elements form the thin rocking crust. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Lecture 3: Internal Structure of the earth crust}
\hfill Date: 08/07/2023 

Internal structure of the earth consists of the followings:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Earth crust 
  \item Mantle 
  \item Core 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Earth Crust (Lithosphere)}
Outer envelope of shell of the earth is known as earth crust. This crust consists of solid rocks. The thickness of earth crust ranges from 5 to 70 km.

Two part of earth's crust:\\
i) Outer crust \\
ii) Lower crust 

\vspace*{0.5cm}
The earth's outer crust mainly consists of sedimentary rocks. \\
Outer crust:\\
i) Continental crust (30 km thick, average specific gravity 2.8, high over 0.2 to 0.3 km above sea)\\
ii) Oceanic crust (5km thick, average specific gravity 2.9, 4 to 5 km sea level)

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
The lower part of earth crust has two envelopes. \\
Lower crust: \\
i) Granite Layer \\
ii) Basalt Layer \\

\vspace*{0.5cm}
The average thickness of each of this layer ranges from 15 to 20 km. 


\subsection*{Tectonic Plates and Plate Boundaries}
Lithosphere consists of spherical caps or plates. These plates are in relative motion to each other on the non-rigid asthenosphere. \\
There may be a - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Collision
  \item Pulling away 
  \item Slide Past one another 
\end{itemize}

The theory that explains this processes is called plate tectonic theory.

\vspace*{1cm}

Plates may be - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continental (Eurasian Plate) \\ - Thick and relatively light.
  \item Oceanic (Pacific Plate) \\ - Thin and made up of wavy igneous rocks.
\end{itemize}

Mountain ranges, ocean basins, major features of earth etc are found due to the movement of plate boundaries.

\end{figure}


\subsection*{Classification of Plate Boundaries} 
Three types of plate boundaries exist:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Divergent Boundaries 
  \item Convergent Boundaries 
  \item Transcurrent Boundaries 
\end{enumerate}
